started collecting leaves when I was a young child. Today, it is my favorite hobby. Leaves come in many different shapes and sizes. You can make a lot of things with them. One fun project that I always tell my friends about is called \"leaf pictures\". You need to do this project in autumn so that collecting your leaves will be more enjoyable. Now, I want to tell you how to make a leaf picture. Before you start, you will need some leaves, paper, paint, a paint brush and glue. First, glue the leaves onto the paper. Wait for an hour. Then, paint over the leaves and the paper. Let the paint dry. Last step, carefully take the leaves off the paper. You will see a beautiful leaf pattern. You can make birthday cards, wrapping paper, or other things with your leaf pictures.
